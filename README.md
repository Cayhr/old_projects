# Old Projects
Repo for all my old projects from highschool and undergraduate study that I care about.

## Cerulean Wings
A game I made in high school for my senior project using Game Maker Studio 2.
It is a bullet hell set in space, where you control a space ship and try to fight past hordes of enemy ships and then a final boss.
It's pretty dinky and features **a ton** of copyrighted content (sounds, music, and pngs), because I was just a wee high schooler.
Ships are pulled from Star Sonata C1, sounds are from Mega Man and Star Sonata, music is from Borderlands 2, Brave Frontier, and Xenoblade Chronicles X.
Obviously, I don't monetize the game. It was my introduction into computer science and game development.

## Marinus Invasion
Spiritual successor to Cerulean Wings I (re)created in Scratch for my Video Game Technologies class at University of the Pacific.
Also a bullet hell (since the concept is easy and interesting enough for quick, small games), but with significantly more polish and better systems.
Its assets are taken from what I used in Cerulean Wings, and the game instead plays going left to right instead of down to up.
This one is also not monetized; it was a for a class and for learning purposes.
